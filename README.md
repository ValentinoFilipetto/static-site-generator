# Staticleine

This static site generator will help you create sites that evoke memories or ideas, just like eating a madeleine:

> In In Search of Lost Time (also known as Remembrance of Things Past), author Marcel Proust uses madeleines to contrast involuntary memory with voluntary memory. The latter designates memories retrieved by "intelligence", that is, memories produced by putting conscious effort into remembering events, people, and places.
